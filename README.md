# stat-6990-dataset-structure

This repository serves as a template for a STAT 6990 project assignment, where students are tasked with preparing a network data set. This project emphasizes the importance of data preparation, reproducibility, and documentation.

A simple network is used an an example.

## Repository Structure

* `network.gml`: This file contains the network file in a standard format (GML, GraphML, JSON, or CSV) with all necessary attributes. Here I've used GML as an example.
* `/reproduction_files`: A sub-repository with all original data and scripts or notebooks needed to transform the original data into the final network structure.
* `network_card.json`: The network card providing a concise summary of the dataset, located in the base folder.
* `README.md`: This document, explaining the repository's structure and purpose.

## License

* **ODC-BY** : Similar to CC-BY but specifically designed for data.

Choose a license that aligns with your intentions for data sharing and reuse. Add a `LICENSE` file in your repository with the chosen license text.
